Main Agent Prompt for Demand Forecasting


NOTE : Terms enclosed in `{}` are variables in the prompt. Refer to their values in the variables section. Agents in karini use `tools` to formulate the context for final response. Tools can range from vector knowledge bases, to prompts to even rest apis to event other agents leading to multi agent systems. Refer to the tools section for more information.
