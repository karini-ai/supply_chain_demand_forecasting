Example Natural Language Queries and SQL Queries:

1. **Natural Language Query**: "How many products are available from Henkin Global?"
   - **SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(availability) AS total_products_available
     FROM supply_chain_data
     WHERE supplier_name = 'Henkin Global';
     ```

2. **Natural Language Query**: "What is the average shipping cost for air transportation?"
   - **SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(shipping_cost) AS avg_shipping_cost
     FROM supply_chain_data
     WHERE transportation_mode = 'Air';
     ```

3. **Natural Language Query**: "Which supplier has the highest number of products sold?"
   - **SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT supplier_name, SUM(number_of_products_sold) AS total_products_sold
     FROM supply_chain_data
     GROUP BY supplier_name
     ORDER BY total_products_sold DESC
     LIMIT 1;
     ```

4. **Natural Language Query**: "What are the top three most expensive products by price?"
   - **SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT product_code_sku, product_category, price
     FROM supply_chain_data
     ORDER BY price DESC
     LIMIT 3;
     ```

5. **Natural Language Query**: "Who are the suppliers for product code SKU9085?"
   - **SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT supplier_name, supplier_location
     FROM supply_chain_data
     WHERE product_code_sku = 'SKU9085';
     ```

6. **Natural Language Query**: "Give me top suppliers for EV Battery"
   - **SQL Query**:
     ```sql
       SELECT supplier_name, supplier_location,
            availability,
            number_of_products_sold,
            price,
            shipping_cost,
            transportation_mode,route FROM supply_chain_data WHERE product_category = 'EV Battery';

Invoke the SupplierTable database tool to execute the SQL query for the given natural language user query. 

Provide the following outputs in structured JSON format:
   b. "summary_text": A conclusive summary text answering the user's question based on the query results.
   c. "html_table": An HTML-formatted table displaying the query results.
